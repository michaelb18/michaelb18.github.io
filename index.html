<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm in the class of 2022 at Virginia Tech. I'm currently a 
General 
Engineering major and I intend to major in Computer Science staring 
next Fall. I've chosen to major in Computer Science because I enjoy 
solving difficult problems with code and I think becoming an 
engineer will allow me to make a positive impact on the world.</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>C++></li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a Linux environment</li>
<li>Comfortable working with GitHub and Git Repositories</li>
<li>Confortable with using IDEs such as PyCharm and Eclipse as well as 
low-level text editors like nano.</li>
</ul></p>
<h3>Baseballbot</h3>
<p>Baseballbot a tool I use to project the statistics of baseball 
players. This project consists of several Tensorflow models, each of 
which are trained to project one statistic. For example, one model 
predicts how many home runs a player will hit per year, another 
predicts how many runs batted in he will get and so on for every 
statistic. I use the project to gain 
an advantage 
in my fantasy 
baseball league, and I've had a lot of success so far in initial 
testing of the projectors.</p>
<h3>Infinitam</h3>
<p>This is my Microsoft Imagine Cup 2019 team. We are one of the 
Archimedes design teams in the Galipatia Living and Leaning 
community at Virginia Tech. The team is working on an app on iOS 
that evaluates the health of bee hives. The main mission behind the 
project is to provide an easy way to evaulate hive health to 
hobbyist bee keepers. I am working on making a deep learning model 
to evaluate the bee health for the app.</p>
<h3>VT Baja Testing Team</h3>
<p>I help program the sensor suite for the Virginia Tech Baja 2019 Car. 
Specifically, I coded the data reading software in C++ for the Intertial 
Measurement Unit(IMU), Linear Potentiometer, and several other sensors. 
I also helped make 
software to write data from the sensors to a CSV file. 
</p>
<p>I'm also working on VT Baja's secure storage project, which is an 
inventory management system for drill bits. I used the Google Drive 
API to write software in python that could upload data from the 
inventory management system to a Google sheet.</p>
