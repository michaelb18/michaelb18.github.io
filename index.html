<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm in the class of 2022 at Virginia Tech. I'm currently a 
Computer Science major. I've chosen to major in Computer Science because I enjoy 
solving difficult problems with code and I think becoming an 
engineer will allow me to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

<h3>Infinitam</h3>
<p>Microsoft Imagine Cup 2020 team. The team is working on an app on iOS 
that evaluates the health of bee hives. The main mission behind the 
project is to provide an easy way to evaulate hive health to 
hobbyist bee keepers.</p>
<h3>VT Baja Testing Team</h3>
<p>I help program the sensor suite for the Virginia Tech Baja 2020 Car. 
Specifically, I coded the data reading software in C++ for the Intertial 
Measurement Unit(IMU), Linear Potentiometer, and several other sensors. 
I also helped make 
software to write data from the sensors to a CSV file.

<h3> RLBot </h3>
<p>
Over the past year I've made a bot that plays Rocket League, which is a video game where cars play soccer. I just finished my second attempt, named "koramund", and I am now working on a third attempt that will employ reinforcement learning to optimize movement around the field. More information on Rocket League Bots can be found at <a href="www.rlbot.org">rlbot.org</a>. I will also post more information about both koramund and my new bot on this website. <br> If you want to see koramund in action against the some of the world's best rocket, check out the Lightfall tournament held October 2019: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/10ElR3IGBb8?start=2546" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3> LoCurated </h3>
LoCurated is a local delivery business I help run with two of my friends. My role is to design and implement that algorithm that tells our drivers what order to deliver packages in. There are a lot of ways to route drivers around Blacksburg and Christiansburg, so I'm almost always thinking about different ways and new algorithms to increase our business's throughput.
