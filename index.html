<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I'm in the class of 2022 at Virginia Tech. I'm currently a 
General 
Engineering major and I intend to major in Computer Science staring 
this Fall. I've chosen to major in Computer Science because I enjoy 
solving difficult problems with code and I think becoming an 
engineer will allow me to make a positive impact on the world.</p>

<h3>Infinitam</h3>
<p>Microsoft Imagine Cup 2020 team. The team is working on an app on iOS 
that evaluates the health of bee hives. The main mission behind the 
project is to provide an easy way to evaulate hive health to 
hobbyist bee keepers.</p>
<h3>VT Baja Testing Team</h3>
<p>I help program the sensor suite for the Virginia Tech Baja 2019 Car. 
Specifically, I coded the data reading software in C++ for the Intertial 
Measurement Unit(IMU), Linear Potentiometer, and several other sensors. 
I also helped make 
software to write data from the sensors to a CSV file.
