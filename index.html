<h2>I use my projects to explore and learn about programming</h2>
<h3>AI</h3>
<h4>Baseballbot</h4>
<p>One of my primary interests is AI. My first AI is called 
baseballbot. It's a tool I use to project the statistics of baseball 
players. I use the project to gain an advantage in my fantasy 
baseball league, and I've had a lot of success so far in initial 
testing of the projectors.</p>
<h4>Infinitam</h4>
<p>This is my Microsoft Imagine Cup 2019 team. We are one of the 
Archimedes design teams in the Galipatia Living and Leaning 
community at Virginia Tech.</p>
<h3>VT Baja Testing Team<h3>
<p>I help program the sensor suite for the Virginia Tech Baja 2019 Car. 
Specifically, I coded the data reading software for the Intertial 
Measurement Unit(IMU) and Linear Potentiometer. I also helped make 
software to write data from the sensors to a CSV file. 
</p>
<p>I'm also working on VT Baja's secure storage project, which is an 
inventory management system for drill bits.</p>
